## Overview

TeamUSA2025 is a web application that integrates excel spreadsheet worksheets to create a user-friendly financial stress testing tool. It is designed for implementing the Fiscal Sustainability Model in a more streamlined and less daunting process than the traditional methods.

The database will be created with the use of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). **The rest of this page will be updated as the project moves along.**
